# time series data
##################

# The time series object and interface are intended to model possibly
# high-dimensional arrays where the first dimesion represents and remaining
# dimension represent a scalar, vector, etc. that evolves in time.

# As such, this package seeks to treat time-series data as representing arrays
# with ambient and often common time axes. Alternatively, time series could be
# thought of as modeling functions that map time to the space of the array
# cross-sections. In this sense, this package seeks to lift operations on arrays
# to operate on time series.

# There are other packages such as JuliaStats/TimeSeries or JuliaData/DataFrames
# that could be applicable to time-series data. However, none of these seem to
# be quite applicable due to inflexibility in representation of time and
# inflexibility with data dimension respectively

# Note: "_data" methods can be deprecated given the array interface although
# some may still be usefull or necessary for odd jobs.

# A good example of when get_data would be useful is when it makes sense to
# discard the time array for the underlying data array. This can happen when the
# "data" encodes a range or an abstract notion of time such as an iteration
# number. While "iterations" may have been published in real time and been used
# to construct a time array, they may also be used as the time component of new
# TimeSeries objects. In such cases, it generally makes sense to use an
# appropriate Array for the time data rather than defining the TimeSeries in
# terms of another TimeSeries.
